# How to Update Your Paper and Publish to GitHub

This guide helps you address the reviewer's comment about open-source availability.

## 📝 Step 1: Update Your Paper

### Update the Conclusion Section

**Before:**

> Our open-source framework enables reproducible research and can be adapted for other epidemiological prediction tasks.

**After:**

> Our open-source framework enables reproducible research and can be adapted for other epidemiological prediction tasks. The complete implementation, including all datasets, code, and documentation, is publicly available at: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mental-health-prediction (replace with your actual GitHub URL once published).

### Add Code Availability Section

Add this section before the References:

```
Code Availability

The complete source code for this study is available under the MIT License at:
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mental-health-prediction

The repository includes:
- Modular Python implementation of all methods
- Complete datasets used in the analysis
- Comprehensive documentation and setup guide
- Reproduction instructions

To reproduce our results:
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mental-health-prediction.git
2. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the analysis: python main.py

Expected runtime: 5-10 minutes on standard hardware (8GB RAM, 4-core CPU).

All results, including figures and tables presented in this paper, are automatically
generated by the pipeline and saved to the results/ and figures/ directories.
```

### Update Abstract (Optional but Recommended)

Add at the end of abstract:

> All code and data are publicly available to ensure reproducibility.

### Add GitHub Link to Tables/Figures Captions (Optional)

Example:

> **Table 1**: Summary statistics of mental health disorder prevalence. Code to reproduce: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mental-health-prediction

## 🚀 Step 2: Publish to GitHub

### Option A: Using GitHub Desktop (Easier)

1. **Create GitHub Account** (if you don't have one)

   - Go to https://github.com
   - Click "Sign up"

2. **Install GitHub Desktop**

   - Download from: https://desktop.github.com
   - Install and sign in

3. **Create Repository**

   - Open GitHub Desktop
   - File → New Repository
   - Name: `mental-health-prediction`
   - Description: "Machine learning framework for mental health prediction"
   - Local Path: Navigate to your `mental-health-prediction-framework` folder
   - Click "Create Repository"

4. **Publish to GitHub**

   - Click "Publish repository"
   - Uncheck "Keep this code private" (for open source)
   - Click "Publish repository"

5. **Your code is now public!**
   - URL will be: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mental-health-prediction

### Option B: Using Command Line

```bash
cd mental-health-prediction-framework

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Mental health prediction framework v1.0"

# Create repository on GitHub (do this first on github.com)
# Then link and push:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mental-health-prediction.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## ✅ Step 3: Verify Publication

After publishing, check:

1. **Repository is public**: Anyone can view it without login
2. **README displays correctly**: Main page shows your README
3. **All files are present**: Check data/, src/, results/, figures/
4. **Links work**: Test the GitHub URL

## 📋 Step 4: Update Your Paper with Actual URL

**Replace ALL instances of:**

```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mental-health-prediction
```

**With your actual GitHub URL:**

```
https://github.com/your-actual-username/mental-health-prediction
```

**Update in these files:**

1. Your paper manuscript
2. README.md (in the repository)
3. CITATION.cff (in the repository)
4. main.py (in the repository)

## 🎯 Step 5: Add DOI (Optional but Recommended)

For permanent archiving:

1. **Link to Zenodo** (https://zenodo.org)

   - Sign in with GitHub
   - Enable repository for archiving
   - Create a release on GitHub
   - Zenodo automatically creates DOI

2. **Add DOI to paper:**

   ```
   Code available at: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mental-health-prediction
   Archived at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.XXXXXXX
   ```

3. **Add DOI badge to README:**
   ```markdown
   [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.XXXXXXX.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.XXXXXXX)
   ```

## 📧 Step 6: Respond to Reviewer

**Sample Response:**

> **Reviewer Comment**: "The Conclusion states 'Our open-source framework enables reproducible research' but the paper should explicitly state where this implementation can be accessed."

**Your Response**:

> We thank the reviewer for this important observation. We have now published the complete implementation as an open-source repository under the MIT License. We have updated the manuscript as follows:

> 1. **Conclusion section (Page X)**: Added explicit GitHub repository URL
> 2. **New "Code Availability" section (Page X)**: Added comprehensive details about code access, including repository URL, installation instructions, and reproduction steps
> 3. **Abstract (Page X)**: Added statement about public code availability

> The repository (https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mental-health-prediction) includes:
>
> - Complete modular Python implementation
> - All datasets used in the analysis
> - Comprehensive documentation (README, setup guide)
> - Step-by-step reproduction instructions
> - Expected runtime: 5-10 minutes

> We believe this addresses the reviewer's concern and significantly enhances the reproducibility of our research.

## ✨ Best Practices

1. **Keep repository clean**: Remove test files, old versions
2. **Update README**: Keep documentation current
3. **Respond to issues**: Monitor GitHub issues/questions
4. **Version control**: Use tags for paper versions (v1.0, v1.1)
5. **Add examples**: Include sample outputs
6. **Write good commit messages**: "Added feature X" not "update"

## 🔄 Making Updates

After initial publication, to update code:

```bash
# Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Fixed bug in clustering module"
git push

# For major updates, create a release:
# Go to GitHub → Releases → Create new release
# Tag: v1.1.0
# Description: What changed
````

## 🎓 Citation Instructions

Add to your paper's references:

```bibtex
@software{yourname2024framework,
  author = {Your Name},
  title = {Mental Health Prediction Framework},
  year = {2024},
  url = {https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mental-health-prediction},
  version = {1.0.0}
}
```
